```lrc
[00:05.44] Raindrops are falling on my head
[00:09.90] And just like the guy whose feet
[00:12.29] Are too big for his bed
[00:15.65] Nothing seems to fit
[00:17.94] Those raindrops
[00:20.11] Are falling on my head
[00:21.93] They keep falling.
[00:30.93] 
[00:24.16] So I just did me some
[00:27.15] Talking to the sun
[00:30.45] And I said I didn't like the way
[00:33.41] He got things done
[00:36.16] He's sleeping on the job
[00:38.60] Those raindrops
[00:40.80] Are falling on my head
[00:42.66] They keep fallin'
[00:51.16] 
[00:44.98] But there's one thing I know
[00:50.77] The blues they send to meet me
[00:54.72] Won't defeat me it won't be long
[00:59.82] Till happiness
[01:01.87] Steps up to greet me
[01:11.87] 
[01:09.76] Raindrops keep falling on my head
[01:13.94] But that doesn't mean my eyes
[01:16.26] Will soon be turning red
[01:20.21] Crying's not for me cause,
[01:23.06] I'm never gonna stop the rain
[01:25.78] By complaining,
[01:27.96] Because I'm free
[01:32.45] Nothings worrying me
[01:42.45] 
[01:45.03] It won't be long
[01:46.84] Till happiness
[01:48.60] Steps up to greet me
[01:58.60] 
[01:56.28] Raindrops keep falling on my head
[02:00.44] But that doesn't mean my eyes
[02:02.79] Will soon be turning red
[02:06.33] Crying's not for me cause,
[02:09.68] I'm never gonna stop the rain
[02:12.31] By complaining,
[02:14.56] Because I'm free
[02:19.05] Nothings worrying me
